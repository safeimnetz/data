# Safe im Netz Data

This repository contains all the data of the **Save im Netz** app.

## Create and edit content

Add the metadata of your task to `content.json`.

Create an `.html` file in `/tasks` which is named after the value you have assigned to the `contentUrl` property.

You can use the `editor.html` file in your browser to edit the HTML content. Click on the Source button in the editor to view, copy and paste the HTML file content.

**Note:** The editor does not safe your HTML content in any way. So any reload deletes your typed content. Make sure to copy the content into the HTML files immediately.
